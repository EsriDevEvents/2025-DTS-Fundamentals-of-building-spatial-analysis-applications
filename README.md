# Fundamentals of building spatial analysis applications
Learn how to build applications that can find relationships, discover 
patterns, and solve problems using spatial analysis. We will explore 
different types of analysis such as geometry analysis, features 
analysis, raster analysis, and 3D visual analysis.
